### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture Diagram.png"><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Three of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
* `ConfigCenter` : Used by many classes to access and save the config
* `EphemeralDB` : Used by the UI as well as the Controller, so that the Controller is able to refer to items in the UI level. One example would be for the controller to get the index each item was listed, since the ordering of items is only determined at the UI level.

The rest of the App consists of the following.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of tha App.
* [**`InputHandler`**](#inputhandler-component) : The command receiver.
* [**`Controller`**](#controller-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the components defines an _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<img src="images/UiArchitecture.png"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` uses the JavaFX UI framework. The UI consists of a `MainWindow`, which contains the application shell components such as the `Header` and the `Console`, and a currently displayed `View`, denoted by `currentView`. Each `View` will define the layout and subcomponents that will be rendered within the `View`.

#### Components

The `UI` is predicated on the concept of a **Component**. A Component is a single sub-unit of the UI, and should preferably only be responsible for a single item or functionality in the UI. For example, a task item in the UI is a single Component, as it is responsible for purely displaying the task information. A task list is also a Component, as it contains multiple task items, and it is responsible just for rendering each task item.

Hence, a Component has the following properties:

- Associated with FXML files
- Loaded with `load`
- Able to accept **props**
- Rendered in placeholder panes
- Can load sub-Components

*Note: The concept of Components and their associated behaviours came from [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a modern JavaScript library for the web.*

##### Associated with FXML files

Each Component is associated with a matching `.fxml` file in the `src/main/resources/ui` folder. For example, the layout of the [`TaskList`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/ui/components/TaskList.java) Component is specified in [`TaskList.fxml`](../src/main/resources/ui/components/TaskList.fxml).

To learn more about FXML, check out this [tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/fxml_tutorial.htm).

##### Loaded with `load`

To load a Component from FXML, use the `load` method found on Component, which calls `UiPartLoader` to read the FXML file, loads a JavaFX Node onto the Stage, and returns the Component which can control the Node on the Stage.

Example usage:

``` java
TaskList taskList = load(primaryStage, placeholderPane, TaskList.class);
```

##### Able to accept props

Components should define a set of public fields or **props** so that dynamic values can be passed into the Component and displayed. These props can be displayed in the UI at the `componentDidMount` phase, which will be explained more below.

For example, to pass in tasks to a TaskList component, simply set the value of `taskList.tasks`, or however it is defined in `TaskList`.

##### Rendered in placeholder panes

After props have been passed, the loaded node can be rendered into a placeholder `Pane`. Typically, these panes are `AnchorPane`s defined in the layout in the FXML file.

##### Can load sub-Components

Every Component has a method called `componentDidMount`, which is run after `render` is called. Hence, there are a few uses of `componentDidMount`:

- Control UI-specific properties which cannot be done in FXML
- Set UI component values (e.g. using `setText` on an FXML `Text` object)
- Load sub-Components and propogate the chain

Hence, a Component can contain further sub-Components, where each Component is not aware of its parent and only renders what it is told to (via props).

Example usage:

``` java
public void componentDidMount() {
    // Set Text field value
    textField.setText(textProp);

    // Load and render sub-components
    SubComponent sub = load(primaryStage, placeholderPane, SubComponent.class);
    sub.value = subTextValue;
    sub.render();
}
```

#### Views

A `View` is essentially a special type of Component, with no implementation differences at the moment. However, a `View` is the grouping of Components to form the whole UI experience. In the case of this app, the `View` corresponds with the portion between the Header and the Console. Different `View`s can be loaded depending on the context.

#### MultiComponents

A `MultiComponent` is also a special type of Component, except that the `render` method behaves differently. Successive calls to `render()` would cause the node to the rendered to the placeholder multiple times, instead of replacing the old node. This is especially useful for rendering lists of variable items, using a loop.

To clear the placeholder of previously rendered items, use `MultiComponent.reset(placeholder)`.

Example usage:

``` java
public void componentDidMount() {
    // Reset items
    TaskItem.reset(placeholder);

    // Load multiple components
    for (Task task : tasks) {
        TaskItem item = load(primaryStage, placeholder, TaskItem.class);
        item.value = task.value;
        item.render();
    }
}
```

### InputHandler component

<img src="images/InputHandler.png"><br>

The InputHandler is the bridge facilitating the handoff from the View to the Controller when the user enters an input.

**API** : [`InputHandler.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/ui/components/InputHandler.java)

1. The console input field will find a `Controller` which matches the command keyword (defined to be the first space-delimited word in the command).
2. The matched `Controller` selected will process the commands accordingly.
3. The InputHandler also maps aliased commands back to their original command keyword.
3. If no Controllers were matched, the console would display an error, to indicate an invalid command.
